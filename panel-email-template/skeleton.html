		            	<div>
							<p>The expanded-cinema performance piece Skeleton, is a collaboration between the noise trio Sult (Oakland / Oslo) and filmmaker Greg Pope (London). </p>
							<p>The darkened room, our cave, our shelter and religion. Ghosts dancing in the flame, images are cast and wood splits. Sound and light waves vibrate and refract. The skeleton is animated; a shadowy play in four movements.</p>
		
		<p>Meditative and mind-altering light and sound experience by Sam Rowell</p>
		
							<p>Rikki Rothenberg will perform a dance work that is engaged with the unknown and the invisible - exploring the body's inherent knowledge with respect to what is needed and looking at the needs of a space. She is joined by Jeffrey Kriksciun. </p>
							<p>$7 suggested donation, dress warmly</p>
