<sup style="font-size:30px;color:white;">1</sup><i><span class="small">This exhibition includes new video and sculpture and marks the largest showing of Aimee Goguen’s work to date. As part of the installation, Goguen has included over 25 works from artists in her community. Each of these artists have collaborated with Goguen as performers in her video pieces. We hope that this exhibition speaks to the ways that art is always produced in community, that it does not appear discreet out of the void, but rather it is made through exchange, and floats on the stream of the collective unconscious.</i></span>
