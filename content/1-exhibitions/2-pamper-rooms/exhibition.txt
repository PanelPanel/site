Description: Pamper Rooms will show new paintings and sculpture from Daniel Long and Alexandra Eastburn. Living and working together on site for six weeks, the two artists have created a series of environments within the gallery. A snake through the walls, alters and stalls. Pamper, a line of sight, co-ocurring horizons move down the hall.
