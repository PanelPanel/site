**Snake charming** is the practice of pretending to [hypnotize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnotism) a [snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake) by playing an instrument called [pungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pungi) or bansuri. A typical performance may also include handling the snakes or performing other seemingly dangerous acts, as well as other [street performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busking) staples, like [juggling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juggling) and [sleight of hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleight_of_hand). The practice is most common in India, though other Asian nations such as Pakistan,[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_charming#cite_note-1) Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Malaysia are also home to performers, as are the North African countries of Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia.

[Ancient Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt) was home to one form of snake charming, though the practice as it exists [today](http://airmail.calendar/2017-04-22%2012:00:00%20PDT) likely arose in India. It eventually spread throughout Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa. Despite a sort of golden age in the 20th century, snake charming is [today](http://airmail.calendar/2017-04-22%2012:00:00%20PDT) in danger of dying out. This is due to a variety of factors, chief among them the recent enforcement of a 1972 law in India banning ownership of snakes. In retaliation, snake charmers have organized in recent years, protesting the loss of their only means of livelihood, and the government has made some overtures to them.

Many snake charmers live a wandering existence, visiting towns and villages on market days and during festivals. With a few rare exceptions they make every effort to keep themselves from harm's way. The charmer typically sits out of biting range and the snake is sluggish and reluctant to attack anyway. More drastic means of protection include removing the creature's [fangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fang) or [venom glands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_venom), or even sewing the snake's mouth shut. The most popular species are those native to the snake charmer's home region, typically various kinds of [cobras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra), though [vipers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viperidae) and other types are also used.

Although snakes are able to sense sound, they lack the outer ear that would enable them to hear the music. They follow the pungi that the "snake charmer" holds with their hands. The snake considers the person and pungi a threat and responds to it as if it were a predator.

"It is very difficult to study and discuss things such as Yoga and Alchemy, for inherently we must create some sort of definition and articulation of what exactly is included in these activities. But when we are discussing activities that, according to origin legends, were taught to mankind over eons of time through different cultures and languages by serpents from the sky, these definitions are anything but definite."

"For you see, the simple act of not sleeping can make one hallucinate and disassociate from reality.  Now this is odd because those are the very things which occur in sleep itself.  It is as if the dream is going to happen one way or another, whether we close our eyes or not, we can not stop the dream from overtaking us in a compulsive possession.  Our minds go into Hallucinations of their own accord if we do not get them delivered by dreams every night."

Notice the real Magic Wand Original is slightly shorter than the fake magic wand.  Also, notice the head cover on the real Magic Wand Original fits correctly and snug versus the fake massager which looks like the head cover is small.  You will also notice the difference in the plug section at the base of these massagers.â€‹
