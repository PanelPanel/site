Please join us for a special screening of *Apple Pie*, a new film by Sam Hamilton with a musical performance from Brian Crook (*The Renderers*) and *Metal Rouge* 

(link: https://www.facebook.com/ApplePieArtFilm/ text: APPLE PIE)   is a new feature length experimental film by artist Sam Hamilton (Aotearoa New Zealand / US). Featuring Samoan dancer Loane Papali'i and a cast of 25 others. Apple Pie was shot and produced on super 16mm film over three years in Aotearoa New Zealand, Samoa and at an astrophysics observatory atop a remote mountaintop in eastern Oregon.

Organized around ten semi-autonomous, yet systemically correlative lines of inquiry - each chapter takes a conceptual departure from objects within our solar system, creating a cinematic ecology to playfully yet critically explore the ontological fabric of who – and how - we are in relation to the world/s we inhabit. Apple Pie weaves together strategies of structuralist film with psychedelic optic experience in order to explore deconstructions of political meridians in relationship to “being”.
