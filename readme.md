# Kirby Starterkit

Kirby's default theme is the easiest way to get started with Kirby. You get a beautiful little site with three projects and a pre-configured panel.

## Installation

git clone --recursive https://github.com/getkirby/starterkit.git

## Issues

Kirby 2 and the starterkit are still in beta. Please report any issues with Kirby here: <https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues> and any issues with the panel here: <https://github.com/getkirby/panel/issues>
