					<p>Pamper Rooms will show new paintings and sculpture from Daniel Long and Alexandra Eastburn. Living and working together on site for six weeks, the two artists have created a series of environments within the gallery. A snake through the walls, alters and stalls. Pamper, a line of sight, co-ocurring horizons move down the hall.

					<p>This exhibition includes new video and sculpture and marks the largest showing of Aimee Goguen’s work to date. As part of the installation, Goguen has included over 25 works from artists in her community. Each of these artists have collaborated with Goguen as performers in her video pieces. We hope that this exhibition speaks to the ways that art is always produced in community, that it does not appear discreet out of the void, but rather it is made through exchange, and floats on the stream of the collective unconscious.

	<h3>BIO</h3>
  Aimee Goguen completed her undergraduate studies in Experimental Animation, and then received her MFA in Visual Art at California Institute of the Arts. Her work uses repetition, surface and orifice to explore the grotesque, the intimate and the sensual. Backdrops of videos become sculptures, gestures are distorted, stilled and blown up to become color fields and lo-fi textures are painstakingly produced as pixelated surfaces are rendered in thousands of hand carved and painted blocks of wood. She has participated in several group shows nationally including <i>Protuberances</i> at LAXART, LA, <i>Things,</i> Participant Inc, NY, <i>Outside Museum</i>, with PMOMA and TPL, and <i>Hustle With My Muscle</i>; Outfest, REDCAT, LA. Her animation work is part of the films, <i>Queercore: How to Punk A Revolution</i>, and <i>William S. Burroughs: A Man Within</i>. Goguen co-curates video showcase, <i>After Glow </i>with Harry Dodge.

	<h3>ABOUT</h3>
  <p>PANEL L.A. is a space for contemporary art in Los Angeles California that hosts a residency, exhibitions and events with an emphasis on newly commissioned work and a desire to serve artists and their community. PANEL is engaged in an experiment that incorporates the studio process more directly into the event of the exhibition. We provide artists with a month long residency in the gallery prior to the exhibition and access to an onsite production shop as well as support from our curator, technician and designer. The hope is to find institutional models that support an artist’s practice holistically, and to bring process and practice into the instance of display that exhibition tends to privilege.</p>
Panel is organized by Armbay Zakaria, Chiara Giovando, Neil Doshi
