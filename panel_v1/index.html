HANNAH ARENDT, THE ORIGINS ðŸ˜“F TOTALITARIANISM, 1951
<p>The conviction that everything that happens on earth must be comprehensible to man can lead to interpreting history by commonplaces. Comprehension does not mean denying the outrageous, deducing the unprecedented from precedents, or explaining phenomena by such analogies and generalities that the impact of reality and the shock of experience are no longer felt. It means, rather, examining and bearing consciously the burden which our century has placed on usâ€”neither denying its existence nor submitting meekly to its weight. </p> <p>Comprehension, in short, means the unpremeditated, attentive facing up to, and resisting of, realityâ€”whatever it may be&hellip; The totalitarian attempt at global conquest and total domination has been the destructive way out of all impasses. Its victory may coincide with the destruction of humanity; wherever it has ruled, it has begun to destroy the essence of man. Yet to turn our backs on the destructive forces of the century is of little avail. The trouble is that our period has so strangely intertwined the good with the bad that without the imperialists' &ldquo;expansion for expansion's sake,&rdquo; the world might never have become one; without the bourgeoisie's political device of "power for power's sake," the extent of human strength might never have been discovered; without the fictitious world of totalitarian movements, in which with unparalleled clarity the essential uncertainties of our time have been spelled out, we might have been driven to our doom without ever becoming aware of what has been happening. And if it is true that in the final stages of totalitarianism an absolute evil appears (absolute because it can no longer be deduced from humanly comprehensible motives), it is also true that without it we might never have known the truly radical nature of Evil.</p>

            SRI SRI RÄ€MAKRISHNA KATHÄ€MRITA or THE GOSPEL OF SRI RAMAKRISHNA, 1850 - 1886
<p>Master's prayer to the Divine Mother: The Master was weeping and praying to the Mother in a voice choked with emotion. He prayed to Her with tearful eyes for the welfare of the devotees: </p>
<p>"Mother, please reveal Yourself now and then. Otherwise, how will they live? How will they be encouraged if they don't see You once in awhile?" </p>
<p>Advice to M The Master was still in the ecstatic mood. Suddenly he said to M: "Look here, you have had enough of reasoning. No more of it. Promise that you won't reason any more." M. (with folded hands): "Yes, sir. I won't." MASTER: "You have had enough of it.</p>

				How to make a Bug Out Bag is one of the very first things any prepper should learn how to make, as well as one of the key items in their arsenal of preparedness. In short, a Bug Out Bag is designed to be a relatively light-weight, self-contained, kit stored in a home, or Bug Out Vehicle, which will enable you or your family to survive for 72 hours while en-route to a Bug Out Location.

				A Bug Out Bagâ€™s inclusiveness and contents will vary widely; climate, survival environment, size of family, and survival expertise are all factors to plan for when making a bug out bag.<br>

				<h6>Water</h6>
				<img src="intro-imgs/water.jpg">


				Water is the most basic requirement for any human being to survive; it is essential for our very existence. An active adult requires 640z (1.89 liters) of water per day; however a bare minimum to consider would be approximately half of that amount or 32oz (1 liter) per day. Because lack of fresh water is likely, filtration devices are essential.<br>
